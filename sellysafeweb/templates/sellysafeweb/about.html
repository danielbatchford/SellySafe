        <h3 class="header">About</h3>
        <p class="flow-text">SellySafe aims to let UOB students view reports of incidents occurring around Selly Oak. Is
            someone walking through your garden? Is someone trying to open doors on your street? Report it on the map
            and let others know where and when it happened, allowing them to take necessary precautions
            with regards to the incident. This site gives you an interactive map, letting you see
            recent incidents near you.</p>

        <h3 class="header">Why</h3>
        <p class="flow-text">This was created as a lockdown project to help people stay safe in and around Selly Oak.
            I aim to help improve safety for students living in post first year accommodation. Furthermore, I aim to
            give
            first year students an indication of the safer areas to live in 2nd year, as well as where to avoid when
            going out.
